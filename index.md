Hi there! Welcome to my page!

I am currently pursuing **M.Tech. in CDS at IISc Banglore**. I have a strong academic background, graduating from **IIIT Bhubaneswar with an 8.92 CGPA**. Also, I have **2 years experience** of working at **Dell Technologies as a Software Engineer-IT-2**.

In my previous role at Dell Technologies, I was responsible for developing and maintaining web applications for **Logistics and Supply Chain Management using Angular 2+, Spring Boot (Java 8), PCF, Layer 7 APIs and Oracle queries**. I also had experience with monitoring and remediating vulnerabilities, as well as providing steadfast production support.

I am a highly dedicated and results-oriented individual with strong work ethics and a passion for learning and innovation.
